# OpenAIAPIChat_test1
A ChatBot with a simple UI, developed using Python.

> Attention: The source code for this project is derived from the official OpenAI API documentation and referenced open-source projects, with assistance from AI.

## Abstract

The first version provides a graphical user interface, while the second version adds the capability for streaming output. Through the sample code, you can learn how to build a basic framework for interacting with AI. You can view the debugging API response information by clicking the "debug" button.
